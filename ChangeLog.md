## 1.4.0

* Providing dequeueSTM, isEmpty and isEmptySTM. Users can compose
  their own control queue with dequeueSTM and isEmptySTM.

* Removing enqueueControl: it appeared that PriorityTree is not
  suitable for control frames. ã€€For example, the dependency of all
  control frames is stream 0.  So, PSQ does not contain multiple
  control frames at the same time.  We removed enqueueControl. Users
  should prepare a queue for control frames by themselves.

## 1.3.1

* Defining IllegalTableSizeUpdate.

## 1.3.0

* APIs `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed again. `Precedence` is introduced.

## 1.2.0

* APIs of `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed. `delete` is provided. Internal data structure is changed from random skew heap to priority search queue.
